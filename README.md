# Zika-LAC-Outbreaks
Material (data and model output) to share with colleagues, and code used in analysis.

There are several folders;
## Code - the code used for the modelling of ZIKV transmission. The matlab code is used for the parameter estimation and the R code is used to output the analysis
## Data - several (largely .csv) files of the data used in the analysis
## CountryReports - pdfs of the analysis specific for each country included in the analysis. It is hoped that this information is useful for country-specific questions about ZIKV
