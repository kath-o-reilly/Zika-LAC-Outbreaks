# Zika-LAC-Outbreaks
Material (data and model output) to share with colleagues, and code used in analysis.

There are several folders;
## Code 
The code used for the modelling of ZIKV transmission. The matlab code is used for the parameter estimation and the R code is used to output the analysis. The full number of files used aren't provided but can be used to repeat the parameter estimation (with the exception of the flight analysis). 
## Data 
Several (largely .csv) files of the data used in the analysis. The timing of the peak and annualised incidence are provided, and are used within the parameter estimation.
## CountryReports 
pdfs of the analysis specific for each country included in the analysis. It is hoped that this information is useful for country-specific questions about ZIKV
